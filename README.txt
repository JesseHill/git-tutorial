Git - Under the Hood

Welcome! Open up the "Git - Under the Hood.html" file to go through the tutorial.

The tutorial assumes that you're familiar with basic git operations. You won't need to come up with commands on your own but the tutorial doesn't explain why you might want to do things like "git add", etc.

It also assumes that you are somewhat familiar with the command line, that you have ruby installed and available in your path, and optionally that you have the "tree" utility installed to list files.
